# container-app-operator

The `container-app-operator` is an operator that reconciles `Capp` CRs.

`Capp` (or ContainerApp) provides a higher-level abstraction for deploying containerized Serverless workload, making it easier for end-users to deploy workloads on Kubernetes without being knowledgeable in Kubernetes concepts, while adhering to the standards required by the infrastructure and platform teams without any extra burden on the users.

The operator uses open-source projects, such as [`knative-serving`](https://github.com/knative/serving), [`logging-operator`](https://github.com/kube-logging/logging-operator), [`nfspvc-operator`](https://github.com/dana-team/nfspvc-operator) and [`provider-dns`](https://github.com/dana-team/provider-dns) to create an abstraction for containerized workloads.

## Run Container Service

The `container-app-operator` project can work as a standalone solution, but is mostly used together with the [`rcs-ocm-deployer` project](https://github.com/dana-team/rcs-ocm-deployer), which allows deploying `Capp` workloads in a multi-cluster set-up, using the `OCM` (Open Cluster Management) open-source project.

## High Level Architecture

![Architecture](images/capp-architecture.svg)

1. The `capp controller` reconciles the `Capp` CRs in the cluster and creates (if needed) a `Knative Service` (`ksvc`) CR, a `DommainMapping` CR, and `Flow` & `Output` CRs for every Capp.

2. The `knative controller` reconciles the `ksvc` CRs in the cluster and controls the lifecycle an autoscaler and pods relevant to the `ksvc`.

3. The `nfspvc-operator controller` reconciles the `NFSPVC` CRs in the cluster and creates `PVC` and `PVs` with an external NFS storage configuration (bring your own NFS).

4. The `provider-dns` is a `Crossplane Provider` which reconciles the DNS Record CRs in the cluster and creates DNS Records in the pre-configured DNS provider (bring your own DNS provider).

5. The `cert-external-issuer` reconciles `Certificate` CRs in the cluster and creates certificates using the Cert API.

6. The `logging-operator controller` reconciles the `Flow` and `Output` CRs in the cluster and collects logs from the pods' `stdout` and sends them to a pre-existing `Elasticsearch` index (bring your own indexes).


## Feature Highlights

- [x] Support for autoscaler (`HPA` or `KPA`) according to the chosen `scaleMetric` (`concurrency`, `rps`, `cpu`, `memory`) with default settings.
- [x] Support for HTTP/HTTPS `DomainMapping` for accessing applications via `Ingress`/`Route`.
- [x] Support for `DNS Records` lifecycle management based on the `hostname` API field.
- [x] Support for `Certificate` lifecycle management based on the `hostname` API field.
- [x] Support for all `Knative Serving` configurations.
- [x] Support for exporting logs to an `Elasticsearch` index.
- [x] Support for changing the state of `Capp` from `enabled` (workload is in running state) to `disabled` (workload is not in running state).
- [x] Support for external NFS storage connected to `Capp` by using `volumeMounts`.
- [x] Support for `CappRevisions` to keep track of changes to `Capp` in a different CRD (up to 10 `CappRevisions` are saved for each `Capp`)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. A Kubernetes cluster (you can [use KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)).

2. `knative-serving` installed on the cluster (you can [use the quickstart](https://knative.dev/docs/getting-started/quickstart-install/)).

3. `nfspvc-operator` installed on the cluster (you can [use the `install.yaml`](https://github.com/dana-team/nfspvc-operator/releases)).

4. `provider-dns` and `Crossplane` installed on the cluster (you can [follow the instructions](https://github.com/dana-team/provider-dns) for the provider and [for Crossplane](https://docs.crossplane.io/latest/software/install/)).

5. `certificate-external-issuer` installed on the cluster (you can [use the `install.yaml`](https://github.com/dana-team/cert-external-issuer/releases)).

6. `logging-operator` installed on the cluster (you can [use the Helm Chart](https://kube-logging.dev/docs/install/#deploy-logging-operator-with-helm)).

Everything can also be installed by running:

```bash
$ make prereq 
```

This uses, behind the scenes, a `Helmfile` which is available at the `charts/cappp-prereq-helmfile.yaml` file in this repository.

#### Using the Helmfile

The `Helmfile` defines all the Helm Charts which are installed as prerequisites for `Capp`. It uses a YAML file to define all the different Charts. To run the `Helmfile` directly, use:

```bash
$ helmfile apply -f charts/cappp-prereq-helmfile.yaml
```

`Helmfile`, similarly to Helm, allows setting values for the installed Charts either using a state values file (`--state-values-file`) or using individual key-value pairs (`--state-values-set`). For example, to change the Chart values of the `provider-dns`, which is defined in the Helmfile, you can use:

```bash
$ helmfile apply -f charts/cappp-prereq-helmfile.yaml --state-values-set providerDNSRealmName=<value>
```

#### Customizing the prereq

You can pass different variables to the `Makefile` to control the underlying values in the dependent Charts.

For example, to install `provider-dns` with certain Chart values, do:

```bash
$ make prereq PROVIDER_DNS_REALM=<value> PROVIDER_DNS_KDC=<value> PROVIDER_DNS_POLICY=<value> PROVIDER_DNS_NAMESERVER=<value> PROVIDER_DNS_USERNAME=<value> PROVIDER_DNS_PASSWORD=<value>
```

| Value Name              | Value Default                            | Explanation                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PROVIDER_DNS_REALM      | `DANA-DEV.COM`                           | Defines the name of the Kerberos Realm to use in the provider.                                               |
| PROVIDER_DNS_KDC        | `dana-wdc-1.dana-dev.com`                | Defines the name of the Kerberos Key Distribution Center server.                                             |
| PROVIDER_DNS_POLICY     | `ClusterFirst`                           | Defines the `dnsPolicy` of the `provider-dns` deployment. If used then it should be set to `None`.           |
| PROVIDER_DNS_NAMESERVER | `8.8.8.8`     | The nameserver to use in the `dnsConfig` of the `provider-dns` deployment if `dnsPolicy` is set to `None`.   |
| PROVIDER_DNS_USERNAME   | `dana`                                   | Defines the username to connect to the KDC with.                                                             |
| PROVIDER_DNS_PASSWORD   | `passw0rd`                               | Defines the password to connect to the KDC with.                                                             |

### Deploying the controller

#### Deploy with Helm

Use `Helm` to deploy `Capp` with all the needed resources. Only deploy it after installing the [prereq](#prerequisites).

```bash
$ helm upgrade --install capp-operator --namespace capp-operator-system --create-namespace oci://ghcr.io/dana-team/helm-charts/container-app-operator --version <release>
```

#### Deploy with Makefile

```bash
$ make deploy IMG=ghcr.io/dana-team/container-app-operator:<release>
```

Alternatively, deploy it with Helm (the Chart is available at the `charts/container-app-operator` directory on this repository):

#### Build your own image

```bash
$ make docker-build docker-push IMG=<registry>/container-app-operator:<tag>
```

### Change target autoscaler default values

The `autoscaleConfig` is defined within a `CappConfig CRD` named `capp-config` in the namespaces of the controller.

To modify the target values for the `autoscaler`, modify the existing `CappConfig` resource, in the namespace capp-operator-system with the desired values.

The `autoscaleConfig` section of the `CappConfig` CRD specifies the scale metric types and their target values.

### Using a Custom Hostname

`Capp` enables using a custom hostname for the application. This in turn creates `DomainMapping`, a DNS Record object and a `Certificate` object if `TLS` is desired.

To correctly create the resources, it is needed to provide the operator with the `DNS Config` where the application is exposed. 

This is done using the `dnsConfig` section of the `CappConfig CRD` called `capp-config` which needs to be created in the operator namespace. 

Note the trailing `.` which must be added to the zone name:


## Example `CappConfig`:
```yaml
apiVersion: rcs.dana.io/v1alpha1
kind: CappConfig
metadata:
  name: capp-config
  namespace: capp-operator-system
spec:
  autoscaleConfig:
    rps: "200"
    cpu: "80"
    memory: "70"
    concurrency: "10"
    activationScale: "3"
  dnsConfig:
    zone: capp-zone.com.
    cname: ingress.capp-zone.com.
    provider: dns-default
    issuer: cert-issuer

```

### Enable Persistent Volume extension in Knative

In order to use `volumeMounts` in `Capp`, `Knative Serving` needs to be configured to support volumes. This is done by adding the following lines to the `ConfigMap` of name `config-features` in the `Knative Serving` namespace:

```yaml
kubernetes.podspec-persistent-volume-claim: enabled
kubernetes.podspec-persistent-volume-write: enabled
```

It's possible to use the following one-liner:

```bash
$ kubectl patch --namespace knative-serving configmap/config-features --type merge --patch '{"data":{"kubernetes.podspec-persistent-volume-claim": "enabled", "kubernetes.podspec-persistent-volume-write": "enabled"}}'
```

## Example Capp

```yaml
apiVersion: rcs.dana.io/v1alpha1
kind: Capp
metadata:
  name: capp-sample
  namespace: capp-sample
spec:

                value: capp-env-var
            image: 'ghcr.io/dana-team/capp-gin-app:v0.2.0'
            name: capp-sample
            volumeMounts:
              - name: test-nfspvc
